# Functions Assignment

This repository contains the Java programs for the programming assignment as per the provided specification.  
The submission includes three Java files:

- **ActivationFunction.java** â€” Implements various mathematical activation functions (Heaviside, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softsign, SQNL).
- **Divisors.java** â€” Provides number theory utilities like GCD, relative primality, and Euler's Totient function.
- **AudioCollage.java** â€” Implements basic audio operations like sum, amplification, reversal, and filtering.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

| File                   | Description                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ActivationFunction.java` | Defines static methods for common activation functions.         |
| `Divisors.java`           | Defines static methods for computing GCD, relative primes, and totient. |
| `AudioCollage.java`       | Defines static methods for audio processing.                   |
